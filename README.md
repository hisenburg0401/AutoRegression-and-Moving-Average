# AutoRegression-and-Moving-Average
Using the Mauna Lua CO2 dataset(https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.csv&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1713643950675293&usg=AOvVaw2rmUVeMh_xRhAD9Y8espPW) (monthly) perform forecasting using an MLP and compare the results with that of MA (Moving Average) and ARMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average)  models. Main setting: use previous “K” readings to predict next “T” reading. Example, if “K=3” and “T=1” then we use data from Jan, Feb, March and then predict the reading for April. Comment on why you observe such results. For MA or ARMA you can use any library or implement it from scratch. The choice of MLP is up to you.
